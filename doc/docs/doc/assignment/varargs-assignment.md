# Varargs Assignment

You can assign the results returned from a function to a varargs symbol `...`. And then access its content using the Lua way.

```yuescript
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fn = (ok) -> ok, table.unpack list
ok, ... = fn true
count = select '#', ...
first = select 1, ...
print ok, count, first
```
